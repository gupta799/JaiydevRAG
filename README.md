#FastAPI Microservice with JWT and LlamaIndex Embeddings
#Overview
This microservice is built using FastAPI to provide embeddings generated by LlamaIndex for a subset of documents. It includes JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for secure access and supports dynamic data ingestion to update and maintain the document database for embedding generation.

#Features
JWT Authentication: Secure API access using token-based authentication.
Embeddings Generation: Vector Embeddings generated using LlamaIndex for specific documents.
Dynamic Data Ingestion: Ability to dynamically ingest new documents via API.
FastAPI Framework: High-performance microservice built on FastAPI.
Prerequisites
